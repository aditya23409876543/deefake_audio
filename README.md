# 🎵 Audio Deepfake Detection System

A state-of-the-art deep learning system to detect synthetic audio, voice conversion, and deepfakes using advanced 2D CNN architectures with multiple ensemble strategies.

## 🎯 Overview

This system analyzes audio files to distinguish between:
- **REAL** (Bona fide): Genuine human speech
- **FAKE** (Deepfake/Synthetic): AI-generated or voice-converted speech

It uses multi-feature audio processing (Mel-Spectrograms, MFCC, Phase) combined with ensemble learning for maximum accuracy.

## 🔍 Audio Features Explained

### Mel-Spectrogram
Frequency domain representation using mel-scale (human hearing perception). Better for detecting subtle audio artifacts.

### MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)
Captures phonetic information. Includes first and second derivatives for temporal dynamics.

### Phase Features
Instantaneous frequency analysis. Useful for detecting unnatural phase coherence in synthetic speech.

---

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Audio Input**: User uploads WAV or MP3 file
2. **Feature Extraction**: Convert to 3 audio feature types
3. **Model Processing**: Run through selected model/ensemble
4. **Classification**: Output probability for Real/Fake
5. **Visualization**: Display waveform, spectrogram, and results
